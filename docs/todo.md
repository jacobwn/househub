1. Set up prisma the same way as the first nextjs project ✅
2. Try out the api nextjs CRUD stuff ✅
3. Try out the layout.tsx to make a basic menu/footer (using <header>, <footer> etc.) ✅
4. Try out putting a new image in public/ and linking to it ✅
5. Set up ci/cd github pipeline (runner, environment, secrets). Make a bash script for setting up the runner.
6. Set up so that the page can be reached from jacobvn.com (records pointing to the droplets ip and so on)
7. Set up integrated tests on CRUD stuff (test db etc.)

make sure that prisma works in prod, applies the correct migrations, and make sure that the db-volume is unhurt
